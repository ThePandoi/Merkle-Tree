# About the Project
Often when sending information around in a tree, that information is vulerable to attacks by outsiders. In order to resolve this, this Merkle Tree performs an Authetication Route to Root, allowing the contents to be 
verified that is has not been tampered with before continuing on. It verfies by checking the hashing of the codes and making sure that the path to the root remains intact.
